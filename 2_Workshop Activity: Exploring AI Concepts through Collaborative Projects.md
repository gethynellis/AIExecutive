**Workshop Activity: Exploring AI Concepts through Collaborative Projects**

**Objective:**
Engaging in group-based activities will deepen one's understanding of AI concepts, including business operations, AI evolution, big data, machine learning, and deep learning, and their applications.

**Group Workshop:**
Your instructor will divide participants into three groups. Each group will focus on a specific set of topics and present their findings to the class.

### Group 1: AI in Business Operations and Evolution
**Topics:**
- Introduction to Business Operations
- Evolution of AI in the Business Context

**Activity:**
1. **Case Study Analysis:**
   - Each member selects a business operation area (Marketing, Sales, Finance, HR, Operations) and researches a real-world example of how AI is transforming that area.
   - Prepare a short presentation (3 minutes) on their findings, focusing on the AI technology used and the impact on business operations.



### Group 2: Big Data and Machine Learning
**Topics:**
- Big Data Concepts
- Basic Concepts of AI

**Activity:**
1. **Data Management Challenges:**
   - Discuss and identify the main challenges in big data management (storage, quality, privacy, and integration).
   - Brainstorm potential AI solutions to these challenges and present their ideas in a poster or slide format.




### Group 3: Deep Learning and Advanced Applications
**Topics:**
- Deep Learning: The Next Step
- Applications of ML and DL

**Activity:**


1. **Application Development:**
   - Select a specific application of ML/DL (e.g., healthcare diagnosis, financial fraud detection, autonomous vehicles, NLP chatbots).
   - Develop a project proposal that outlines how deep learning can be applied to solve a problem in this area. Include the steps, required data, and expected outcomes.


### Presentation, Discussion and debrief
- Each group will present their findings and projects to the class (3 minutes per group).
